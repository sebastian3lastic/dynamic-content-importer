# Dynamic-content-importer
Dynamic Content Importer is a simple Figma plugin designed to streamline the process of importing and applying dynamic content to selected components. This plugin allows you to paste data directly into the code and map it to the selected components in your Figma file, updating text and images based on predefined layer names.

Key Features:
Paste-and-go functionality: Easily copy and paste your data into the plugin, which will dynamically replace the content in the Figma components.
Dynamic content mapping: Automatically match the columns from your data to the respective Figma layers using layer names like #titleLeft1, #bodyRight1, #image, and more.
Supports text and images: Seamlessly updates text layers and image fills with new data.
Efficient for bulk updates: Select multiple components simultaneously, and the plugin will apply each row of data to a corresponding component.
## How It Works:
Prepare your data: Copy your data into the pluginâ€™s code. Data can include text fields such as titles, bodies, labels, and image URLs.
Layer naming convention: Ensure that your Figma layers are named to match the data keys (e.g., #titleLeft1, #bodyRight1, #image).
Select components: In Figma, select the components you want to update.
Run the plugin: The plugin will apply the content dynamically to each selected component.
